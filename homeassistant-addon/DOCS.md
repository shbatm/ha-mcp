## Installation


1. **Click the button to add the repository** to your Home Assistant instance:

   [![Add Repository](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/supervisor_add_addon_repository.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/supervisor_add_addon_repository/?repository_url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fhomeassistant-ai%2Fha-mcp)

   Or manually add this repository URL in Supervisor → Add-on Store:
   ```
   https://github.com/homeassistant-ai/ha-mcp
   ```

2. **Navigate to the add-on** "Home Assistant MCP Server" from the add-on store

3. **Click Install, Wait and then Start**

4. **Check the add-on logs** for your unique MCP server URL:

   ```
   🔐 MCP Server URL: http://192.168.1.100:9583/private_zctpwlX7ZkIAr7oqdfLPxw

   ```

5. **Configure your AI client** using one of the options below

---

## Client Configuration

### <details><summary><b>📱 Claude Desktop</b></summary>

Claude Desktop requires a proxy to connect to HTTP MCP servers. Install **mcp-proxy** first:

```bash
# Install mcp-proxy
uv tool install mcp-proxy
# or
pipx install mcp-proxy
```

Then add to your Claude Desktop configuration file:

**Location:**
- macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
- Windows: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`

**Configuration:**
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "home-assistant": {
      "command": "mcp-proxy",
      "args": ["--transport", "streamablehttp", "http://192.168.1.100:9583/private_zctpwlX7ZkIAr7oqdfLPxw"]
    }
  }
}
```

Replace the URL in `args` with the one from your add-on logs.

**Restart Claude Desktop** after saving the configuration.

**How it works:** mcp-proxy converts the HTTP endpoint to stdio that Claude Desktop can use.

</details>

### <details><summary><b>💻 Claude Code</b></summary>

Use the `claude mcp add` command:

```bash
claude mcp add-json home-assistant '{
  "url": "http://192.168.1.100:9583/private_zctpwlX7ZkIAr7oqdfLPxw",
  "type": "http"
}'
```

Replace the URL with the one from your add-on logs.

**Restart Claude Code** after adding the configuration.

</details>

### <details><summary><b>🌐 Web Clients (Claude.ai, ChatGPT, etc.)</b></summary>

For secure remote access, you have two options:

#### Option A: Webhook Proxy Add-on (Simplest — if you have Nabu Casa or an existing reverse proxy)

The **Webhook Proxy** add-on routes MCP traffic through your existing Home Assistant reverse proxy — no separate tunnel needed.

1. Install the **MCP Server add-on** first (if not already installed — see the Installation section above)
2. Install the **"Webhook Proxy for HA MCP"** add-on from the add-on store
3. Start it and **restart Home Assistant** when prompted
4. Copy the URL from the webhook proxy add-on logs:
   ```
   MCP Server URL (remote): https://xxxxx.ui.nabu.casa/api/webhook/mcp_xxxxxxxx
   ```
5. Use that URL in your MCP client

Works with Nabu Casa, Cloudflare, DuckDNS, nginx, or any other reverse proxy pointing at HA.

#### Option B: Cloudflared Add-on (No existing reverse proxy needed)

Use the **Cloudflared add-on** for a dedicated tunnel:

##### Install Cloudflared Add-on

[![Add Cloudflared Repository](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/supervisor_add_addon_repository.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/supervisor_add_addon_repository/?repository_url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fbrenner-tobias%2Faddon-cloudflared)

##### Configure Cloudflared

**Note:** The Cloudflared add-on requires a Cloudflare account and uses named tunnels. You'll need to authenticate via the browser flow when first setting up the tunnel.

Add to Cloudflared add-on configuration:

```yaml
additional_hosts:
  - hostname: ha-mcp  # Named tunnel (requires Cloudflare account)
    service: http://localhost:9583
```

Or with a custom domain (requires DNS setup in Cloudflare):
```yaml
additional_hosts:
  - hostname: ha-mcp.yourdomain.com
    service: http://localhost:9583
```

##### Authenticate and Get Your Public URL

When you first start Cloudflared:

1. **Check the add-on logs** for an authentication URL like:
   ```
   Please open the following URL and log in with your Cloudflare account:
   https://xyz.cloudflare.com/argotunnel?...
   ```

2. **Open the URL in your browser**, log in with your Cloudflare account, and select a website to authorize the tunnel

3. **After authentication**, the logs will show your tunnel URL:
   - Named tunnel: `https://ha-mcp-<random>.cfargotunnel.com`
   - Custom domain: `https://ha-mcp.yourdomain.com` (if DNS configured)

##### Use Your MCP Server

Combine the Cloudflare tunnel URL with your secret path:
```
https://ha-mcp-<random>.cfargotunnel.com/private_zctpwlX7ZkIAr7oqdfLPxw
```

**Benefits:**
- No port forwarding required
- Automatic HTTPS encryption
- Optional Cloudflare Zero Trust authentication
- Centrally managed with other Home Assistant services

**Note on Quick Tunnels:** True Quick Tunnel mode (temporary `*.trycloudflare.com` URLs without account) requires running `cloudflared tunnel --url http://localhost:9583` directly via CLI or Docker, which is not supported by this add-on. The Home Assistant Cloudflared add-on uses named tunnels that require a Cloudflare account for authentication and management.

##### ⚠️ Disable "Block AI Training Bots"

> **This is the most common connection issue for Cloudflare users.** If your LLM client can't connect but visiting the URL in your browser works, this setting is almost certainly the cause.

Cloudflare's "Block AI training bots" feature blocks requests from AI/LLM clients by default. You must disable it:

1. Log in to [Cloudflare](https://dash.cloudflare.com)
2. In the left sidebar, click **Domains**, then click **Overview**
3. Click on the domain you use for connecting to Home Assistant
4. On the right side of the page, find **"Control AI Crawlers"**
5. Under **"Block AI training bots"**, open the dropdown
6. Select **"do not block (allow crawlers)"**

![Cloudflare AI Crawlers Setting](https://homeassistant-ai.github.io/ha-mcp/images/cloudflare-ai-crawlers-setting.jpg)

See [Cloudflared add-on documentation](https://github.com/brenner-tobias/addon-cloudflared/blob/main/cloudflared/DOCS.md) for advanced configuration.

## Configuration Options

The add-on has minimal configuration - most settings are automatic.

### backup_hint (Advanced)

**Default:** `normal`

Controls when the AI assistant suggests creating backups before operations:

- `normal` (recommended): Before irreversible operations only
- `strong`: Before first modification of each session
- `weak`: Rarely suggests backups
- `auto`: Intelligent detection (future enhancement)

**Note:** This is an advanced option. Enable "Show unused optional configuration options" in the add-on configuration UI to see it.

### secret_path (Advanced)

**Default:** Empty (auto-generated)

Custom secret path override. **Leave empty for auto-generation** (recommended).

- When empty, the add-on generates a secure 128-bit random path on first start
- The path is persisted to `/data/secret_path.txt` and reused on restarts
- Custom paths are useful for migration or specific security requirements
- Ignored when OIDC authentication is enabled

**Note:** This is an advanced option. Enable "Show unused optional configuration options" in the add-on configuration UI to see it.

### enable_tool_search

**Default:** `false`

Replaces the full tool catalog (~86 tools, ~46K tokens) with search-based discovery (~4 proxy tools, ~5K tokens). When enabled, tools are found via `ha_search_tools` and executed through categorized proxies (read/write/delete).

**When to enable:**
- Models **without native deferred tool support** — this includes OpenAI-compatible local models, and also **Claude Haiku** which does not use Claude's built-in deferred tool loading. Haiku users will see significant token savings with this enabled.
- Models with **limited context windows** (≤200K) or deployments where context cost is a concern
- MCP clients that **cap total tools** (e.g. at 100) — reduces visible tool count to ~4

**When to leave disabled (default):**
- Claude Sonnet/Opus or other clients with deferred tool support — tools are loaded on demand, so the full catalog has no idle context cost
- When you need direct tool access without the search step

Requires add-on restart to take effect.

### OIDC Authentication Options

All four options must be set to enable OIDC mode. See the **Security > OIDC Authentication** section above for setup instructions.

| Option | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `oidc_config_url` | URL | OIDC provider discovery URL (`.well-known/openid-configuration`) |
| `oidc_client_id` | String | OAuth client ID from your OIDC provider |
| `oidc_client_secret` | Password | OAuth client secret from your OIDC provider |
| `oidc_base_url` | URL | Public HTTPS URL where the MCP server is accessible |

**Example Configuration (with OIDC):**

```yaml
backup_hint: normal
oidc_config_url: "https://auth.example.com/application/o/ha-mcp/.well-known/openid-configuration"
oidc_client_id: "ha-mcp-client"
oidc_client_secret: "your-secret-here"
oidc_base_url: "https://mcp.example.com"
```

**Example Configuration (without OIDC - default secret path mode):**

```yaml
backup_hint: normal
secret_path: ""  # Leave empty for auto-generation
```

---

## Security

### Option 1: OIDC Authentication (Recommended for Remote Access)

For secure remote access, you can configure OIDC authentication with any OpenID Connect provider (Authentik, Keycloak, Auth0, Google, etc.). When enabled, users must authenticate through your OIDC provider before accessing the MCP server.

#### Prerequisites

- An OIDC provider (e.g., Authentik, Keycloak, Auth0)
- A reverse proxy terminating HTTPS (e.g., Caddy, nginx, Cloudflare Tunnel)
- A public HTTPS URL pointing to the add-on's port 9583

#### OIDC Provider Setup

1. **Create an OAuth/OIDC application** in your provider with these settings:
   - **Redirect URI**: `https://your-public-url/auth/callback`
   - **Grant type**: Authorization Code
   - **Token endpoint auth method**: Client Secret Post (or as required by your provider)
   - Note the **Client ID** and **Client Secret**

2. **Find your OIDC Discovery URL**. It typically looks like:
   - Authentik: `https://auth.example.com/application/o/<app-slug>/.well-known/openid-configuration`
   - Keycloak: `https://keycloak.example.com/realms/<realm>/.well-known/openid-configuration`
   - Auth0: `https://<tenant>.auth0.com/.well-known/openid-configuration`
   - Google: `https://accounts.google.com/.well-known/openid-configuration`

#### Add-on Configuration

Fill in all four OIDC fields in the add-on options:

| Option | Description | Example |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| `oidc_config_url` | OIDC Discovery URL | `https://auth.example.com/application/o/ha-mcp/.well-known/openid-configuration` |
| `oidc_client_id` | OAuth Client ID | `ha-mcp-client` |
| `oidc_client_secret` | OAuth Client Secret | `your-client-secret` |
| `oidc_base_url` | Public HTTPS URL of this server | `https://mcp.example.com` |

**All four fields must be set** to enable OIDC mode. If any are missing, the add-on will show an error. Leave all empty to use secret path mode instead.

#### Reverse Proxy Setup

The add-on runs HTTP internally on port 9583. Your reverse proxy must:

1. Terminate TLS (HTTPS)
2. Forward traffic to port 9583
3. Pass through all paths (including `/auth/callback`, `/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server`, `/mcp`)

**Example Caddy configuration:**
```
mcp.example.com {
    reverse_proxy homeassistant.local:9583
}
```

**Example nginx configuration:**
```nginx
server {
    listen 443 ssl;
    server_name mcp.example.com;

    ssl_certificate /path/to/cert.pem;
    ssl_certificate_key /path/to/key.pem;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://homeassistant.local:9583;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
    }
}
```

#### Connecting Claude.ai with OIDC

Once OIDC is configured:

1. In Claude.ai, go to **Settings > Integrations > Add MCP Connector**
2. Enter the MCP endpoint URL: `https://mcp.example.com/mcp`
3. Claude.ai will discover the OIDC endpoints automatically
4. You'll be redirected to your OIDC provider to authenticate
5. After authentication, Claude.ai can access your Home Assistant

### Option 2: Secret Path (Default)

#### Auto-Generated Secret Paths

The add-on automatically generates a unique secret path on first startup using 128-bit cryptographic entropy. This ensures:

- Each installation has a unique, unpredictable endpoint
- The secret is persisted across restarts
- No manual configuration needed

### Supervisor Authentication

The add-on uses Home Assistant Supervisor's built-in authentication. No tokens or credentials are needed - the add-on automatically authenticates with your Home Assistant instance.

### Network Exposure

- **Local network only by default** - The add-on listens on port 9583
- **Remote access** - Use OIDC authentication (recommended) or the Cloudflared add-on for secure HTTPS tunnels
- **Never expose** port 9583 directly to the internet without OIDC authentication or proper security measures

---

## Troubleshooting

### Add-on won't start

**Check the logs** for errors:
- Configuration validation errors
- Dependency installation failures
- Port conflicts (9583 already in use)

**Solution:** Review the error message and adjust configuration or free up the port.

### Can't connect to MCP server

**Verify:**
1. Add-on is running (check status in Supervisor)
2. You copied the **complete URL** including the secret path from logs
3. Your MCP client configuration is correct
4. No firewall blocking port 9583 on your local network

**Solution:** Restart the add-on and copy the URL from fresh logs.

### Lost the secret URL

**Options:**
1. Check the add-on logs (scroll to startup messages)
2. Restart the add-on (logs will show the URL again)
3. Read directly from `/data/secret_path.txt` using the Terminal & SSH add-on
4. Generate a new secret by deleting `/data/secret_path.txt` and restarting

### Operations failing

**Check add-on logs** for detailed error messages. Common issues:

- Invalid entity IDs (use fuzzy search to find correct IDs)
- Missing permissions (add-on should have full access)
- Home Assistant API errors (check HA logs)

**Solution:** Review the specific error in logs and adjust your commands accordingly.

### Performance issues

If the add-on is slow or unresponsive:

1. Check Home Assistant system resources (CPU, memory)
2. Review add-on logs for warnings
3. Restart the add-on
4. Consider reducing concurrent AI assistant operations
