        Retrieve a snapshot image from a Home Assistant camera entity.

        This tool fetches the current camera image and returns it directly for visual
        analysis. Use this when you need to see what a camera is currently viewing.

        **Parameters:**
        - entity_id: Camera entity ID (e.g., 'camera.front_door', 'camera.living_room')
        - width: Optional width to resize the image (reduces token usage for large images)
        - height: Optional height to resize the image

        **Use Cases:**
        - Security checks: "Is someone at the front door?"
        - Pet monitoring: "Is my dog still on the couch?"
        - Delivery verification: "Did my package get delivered?"
        - Visual confirmation: "Did the garage door actually close?"
        - Incident investigation: "What triggered the motion sensor?"

        **Example Usage:**
        ```python
        # Get current snapshot from front door camera
        ha_get_camera_image(entity_id="camera.front_door")

        # Get resized image to reduce token usage
        ha_get_camera_image(entity_id="camera.backyard", width=640, height=480)
        ```

        **Notes:**
        - Only cameras exposed to Home Assistant are accessible
        - The existing HA authentication/authorization applies
        - Images are returned in their native format (JPEG, PNG, or GIF)
        - Use width/height parameters for large high-resolution cameras to reduce
          token usage when full resolution is not needed

        **Related Services:**
        - camera.snapshot: Save snapshot to file on HA server
        - camera.turn_on/turn_off: Control camera power
        - camera.enable_motion_detection: Enable motion detection
