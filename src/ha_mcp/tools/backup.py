        Restore Home Assistant from a backup (LAST RESORT - use with extreme caution).

        **⚠️ WARNING - DESTRUCTIVE OPERATION ⚠️**

        **This tool restarts Home Assistant and restores configuration to a previous state.**

        **IMPORTANT CONSIDERATIONS:**
        1. **Try undo operations first** - Often you can just reverse what you did:
           - Deleted automation? Recreate it with ha_config_set_automation
           - Modified script? Use ha_config_set_script to fix it
           - Most config changes can be rolled back without using restore

        2. **Safety mechanism:** A NEW backup is automatically created BEFORE restore
           - This allows you to rollback the restore if needed
           - You can restore from this pre-restore backup if something goes wrong

        3. **What gets restored:**
           - Home Assistant configuration (automations, scripts, etc.)
           - Add-ons (if they were in the backup)
           - Optional: Database - historical sensor data, statistics, state history (set restore_database=true)

        4. **Side effects:**
           - Home Assistant will RESTART during restore
           - Any changes made after the backup was created will be LOST
           - Temporary disconnection from all integrations during restart

        **Recommended workflow:**
        1. Try to undo your changes manually first
        2. If you must restore, use the most recent backup
        3. Set restore_database=false unless you need historical data
        4. Expect a restart and temporary downtime

        **Example Usage:**
        - Restore config only: ha_backup_restore("dd7550ed")
        - Full restore with DB: ha_backup_restore("dd7550ed", restore_database=true)
