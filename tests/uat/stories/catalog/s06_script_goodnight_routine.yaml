description: >
  User wants a "goodnight" script that performs multiple actions across
  different domains. Tests the agent's ability to discover entities across
  domains and compose a multi-step script sequence. Scripts with multiple
  actions are a core HA management use case.

  - script
  - create
  - multi-action
  - sequence

setup: []
  # Uses existing demo entities

prompt: >
  Create a script called "Goodnight Routine" that does the following in order:
  1. Turns off all lights in the house
  2. Sets any climate/thermostat entity to 18 degrees
  3. Waits 2 seconds between each step
  First check what lights and climate entities I have, then build the script.
  Show me the full sequence you created.

teardown:
  - tool: ha_config_remove_script
    args:
      script_id: "goodnight_routine"

expected:
  tools_should_use:
    - ha_search_entities
    - ha_config_set_script
  description: >
    Agent should search for lights and climate entities, then create a script
    with a sequence of service calls separated by delays. Should use
    light.turn_off (possibly with all entities) and climate.set_temperature.
