  User asks for a dashboard showing a room's key information. Tests the agent's
  ability to discover entities in an area, select appropriate card types, and
  compose a functional dashboard. Dashboard creation is an emerging high-value
  use case per research.

  - dashboard
  - create
  - cards

setup:
  # Ensure an area exists with entities
  - tool: ha_config_set_area
    args:
      name: "Living Room Test"

prompt: >
  Create a new dashboard called "Living Room" with URL path "living-room-test".
  It should show:
  1. All the lights in the home (with toggle controls)
  2. Any temperature or climate entities you can find
  3. A button to turn off all lights at once
  Look up what entities are available first, then build the dashboard.
  Show me what cards you created.

teardown: []

verify:
  questions:
    - "Does a dashboard with URL path 'living-room-test' exist?"
    - "Does it contain cards that show light entities with toggle controls?"
    - "Does it contain any climate or temperature-related cards?"

  tools_should_use:
    - ha_search_entities
    - ha_config_set_dashboard
  description: >
    Agent should first search for light and climate entities, then create a
    dashboard with appropriate cards (entities card for lights, possibly a
    thermostat card, and a button/script for "all off"). Should use
    ha_get_card_types or ha_get_dashboard_guide for card reference.
