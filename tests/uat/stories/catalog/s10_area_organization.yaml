  User wants to organize their home by creating areas and assigning entities.
  Tests area CRUD and entity assignment. Organization is cited as a common
  use case in the Paulus discussion - "help me organize my 200 entities."

setup: []

prompt: >
  Help me organize my smart home. First, create these areas if they don't exist:
  "Kitchen Test", "Bedroom Test", and "Garage Test".
  Then show me all available light entities and suggest which area each one
  should belong to based on its name. Don't actually move them yet, just show
  me your recommendations in a clear table format.

teardown:
  - tool: ha_config_remove_area
    args:
      area_id: "kitchen_test"
  - tool: ha_config_remove_area
    args:
      area_id: "bedroom_test"
  - tool: ha_config_remove_area
    args:
      area_id: "garage_test"

  tools_should_use:
    - ha_config_set_area
    - ha_search_entities
    - ha_config_list_areas
  description: >
    Agent should create the three areas, then search for light entities,
    and present a recommendation mapping. Should use entity names to infer
    area assignment (e.g., "bed_light" → Bedroom). Should NOT move entities
    without confirmation (the prompt says "don't actually move them yet").
