  User asks for an overview of their smart home setup. This tests the agent's
  ability to search, categorize, and summarize entities. A common first

prompt: >
  I just connected you to my Home Assistant. Can you give me an overview of
  what's available? List all areas, then for each area tell me what devices
  and entities are there. Also tell me how many automations and scripts I
  have set up. Give me a nice organized summary.

  description: >
    Agent should use area listing and entity search to build a comprehensive
    overview. Should report on multiple domains (lights, sensors, climate,
    automations, scripts). A good agent will organize the output by area
    and provide counts.
