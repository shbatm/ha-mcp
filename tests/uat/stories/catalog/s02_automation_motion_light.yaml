  This is the second most common automation pattern. Tests the agent's
  ability to use state triggers, conditions or timers, and delayed actions.

  - automation
  - create
  - triggers
  - state
  - delay

setup:
  # Create an input_boolean to simulate a motion sensor
  - tool: ha_config_set_helper
    args:
      helper_type: "input_boolean"
      name: "Kitchen Motion Sensor Test"

prompt: >
  I have a motion sensor (input_boolean.kitchen_motion_sensor_test - it turns on
  when motion is detected). Create an automation called "Kitchen Motion Light" that:
  1. Turns on light.kitchen_lights when motion is detected (the boolean turns on)
  2. Turns off the light 5 minutes after the last motion (when the boolean turns off)
  Make sure it handles repeated motion correctly (restarts the timer).
  Show me what you created.

teardown: []

verify:
  questions:
    - "Does an automation with alias 'Kitchen Motion Light' exist?"
    - "Does it have a state trigger on input_boolean.kitchen_motion_sensor_test?"
    - "Does it use mode 'restart' or 'single' for handling repeated triggers?"
    - "Does it include a delay or wait action for the 5-minute timeout?"

    - ha_search_entities
    - ha_config_set_automation
  description: >
    Agent should create an automation with state trigger on the motion sensor,
    and use a delay or wait_for_trigger pattern for the timeout. Mode should
    be 'restart' to handle repeated triggers correctly (restarts the timer).
