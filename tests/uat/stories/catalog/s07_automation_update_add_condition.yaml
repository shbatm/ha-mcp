  User wants to modify an existing automation by adding a condition.
  This is a read-modify-write workflow that tests the agent's ability to
  fetch existing config, understand its structure, and update it without
  breaking it. A critical pattern for automation management.

  I have an automation called "Evening Lights Test" that turns on lights at 6pm.
  I want to update it so it only triggers when someone is home. There's an
  input_boolean called "Someone Home Test" (input_boolean.someone_home_test) that
  indicates presence. Add a condition to the automation that checks if this boolean
  is on. Don't change anything else about the automation. Show me the updated config.

teardown: []

verify:
  questions:
    - "Does automation 'Evening Lights Test' still exist with its original time trigger at 18:00?"
    - "Does it now have a condition checking input_boolean.someone_home_test is on?"
    - "Does it still have the original action to turn on light.bed_light at 80% brightness?"

  tools_should_use:
    - ha_config_get_automation
    - ha_config_set_automation
  description: >
    Agent should first get the existing automation config, then add a state
    condition checking input_boolean.someone_home_test is "on", and update
    the automation while preserving the existing trigger, action, and other
    settings. Should NOT recreate from scratch.
